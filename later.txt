I want to add a feature to this that lets you give people a URL with an image link and difficulty.
So for example I find the image link "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0b/Sandro_Botticelli_-_La_nascita_di_Venere_-_Google_Art_Project_-_edited.jpg/2880px-Sandro_Botticelli_-_La_nascita_di_Venere_-_Google_Art_Project_-_edited.jpg". 
So for example I find the image link "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0b/Sandro_Botticelli_-_La_nascita_di_Venere_-_Google_Art_Project_-_edited.jpg". And suppose this static puzzle site is hosted at `github.io/puzzle.html`. I want there to be a button on my site called "share puzzle" that opens a box for the user to paste a URL for the image. Then it gives them a link like `github.io/puzzle.html?image=https..." with the link to the image, and they can share that with other people, and clicking on it makes this site automatically load the image at that URL.
Is this possible, or will we have issues with CORS requests or something? If possible, please try to implement it. For now, make this webpage load image links given in that way. Later I'll work on adding the button and textbox on this page.

How to make this a webpage you can save and run offline?
Might need some kind of packager.

Add dark-mode toggle.
Add toggle to stop animations during dragging, for performance.
Add slider for animation speed.

Add sidebar:
Runs entirely in your browser - your images are not sent to any other computer.
Tested on PC and Android.
You can save this webpage and use it offline.
Supports animated GIFs!
(If 3x3 or smaller doesn't work, update your browser.)

When the view is resized, instead of scrambling completely, try to handle it gracefully, preserving the current state of the puzzle as much as possible, shifting groups if necessary.
